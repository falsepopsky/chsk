# chask

`chask` is a charting library for React.

The library provides infrastructure to build dynamic visualizations from the ground up. It contains components to create some commonly-used charts such as bar charts or line charts, and to customize these charts with bespoke elements and styles. It also supports animations for chart-based story-telling.

[Documentation](https://tkonopka.github.io/chask/).

[Examples](https://tkonopka.github.io/chask/?path=/docs/gallery).

## Example

The animation below shows a custom bar chart. The first part of the recording starts with an empty surface, and parts of the chart enter into view in stages. In the second part, the dataset is updated and the bars readjust to display the new data.

All data in the animation is synthetic. A live version of the chart is available [here](https://tkonopka.github.io/chask/?path=/docs/gallery-bar-charts--custom-layout), along with many other examples.
