# @chsk/annotation

`@chsk/annotation` is part of a data visualization framework based on
`@chsk/core`. It provides utilities and graphical elements components that can be
incorporated into any chart type.

## Features

-   **Filters** use svg capabilities to fine-tune the appearance of chart components
-   **Flowchart elements** such as arrows draw attention to specific chart
    elements
-   **Labels** use decorations such as boxes, brackets, or braces to
    associated explanations with chart elements
-   **Markers** use svg capabilities to display lines with custom symbols
    such as arrowheads
-   **Symbols** provide a library of shapes for use as standalone elements,
    points in scatter charts, or in legends
-   **Export utilities** save charts to svg files with in-build optimization
    to achieve small file sizes
-   Other miscellaneous components include decorations for grids
