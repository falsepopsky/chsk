# chsk

chsk is a charting library for React. It aims to provide a stable toolkit for creating graphs for static publications, dynamic components for dashboards, and animated stories for presentations.

The library provides infrastructure for building visualizations from the ground up. It includes components for common chart elements such as axes and labels. It also includes hooks and data-processing functions. These elements can be combined to create commonly-used charts such as line or bar charts, or entirely original and complex visualizations.

## Features

### Base charts

The core library together with its addons provide infrastructure for several commonly-used charts such as bar charts, scatter charts, and heat maps.

### Reusable components

Library components can be applied and used in many chart types. For example, axes and legends can be used in both bar charts and scatter charts.

### Styles and themes

Components can be customized using inline styles and global themes. It is thus possible to quickly change the look-and-feel of a chart by applying a different theme, and to create multiple charts with a consistent appearance.

### Interactivity

Chart components animate changes in underlying data. Certain components can also respond to mouse events.

### Hooks

The library exports React hooks that can be used in custom components. This enables custom components to access information about a chart beyond what is provided via props. For example, a custom component can access the chart dimensions, current dataset in raw format, current dataset in a processed format, scales used for axes, or theme.

### Calculation

Some components perform a limited amount of calculation on data. For example, `Histogram` in package `@chsk/xy` performs data binning to summarize a data distribution. `Quantile` in package `@chsk/band` computes quantiles to display box plots. `Regression` in package `@chsk/xy` performs linear modeling to display a best-fit line.

### Multiple views

The library provides infrastructure for creating charts with multiple 'views'. For example, it is possible to create side-by-side bar graphs or side-by-side scatter graphs within a single graphic.

### Milestone animation

The library provides a scheme to animate the content of a chart based on user interactions. This can be used, for example, to make chart elements appear in stages, as if in a chart 'walk-through'.
