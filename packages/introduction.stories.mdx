# Chask

`chask` is a charting library for React.

The library provides infrastructure to build dynamic visualizations from the ground up. It contains components for creating some commonly-used charts such as bar charts or line charts, and for customizing these charts with bespoke elements and styles. It also supports animations for story-telling.

The goal for the library is to provide a stable toolkit to create complete charts for static publications, dynamic components for dashboards, and animated stories for presentations.

Importantly, `chask` does not aim to create all possible visualization types with dedicated functions/components. Rather, it provides building blocks, hooks, and utility functions that can be combined to create complex visualizations. Chart skeletons built out of library components can also be augmented with custom elements.

## Features

### Reusable components

`chask` provides re-usable components that can be applied in many chart types. For example, axes and legends can be used in both bar charts and scatter charts. A common implementation for these component means that they can be used with the same API, and also styled with the same visual styles and themes.

### Base charts

The library provides infrastructure for some commonly-used charts, for example bar charts, scatter charts, or heat maps.

### Styles and themes

All components can be customized using css. Visual styles are also adjustable via global themes. It is thus possible to quickly change the look-and-feel of charts by applying a different theme, and to create multiple charts with a consistent appearance.

### Interactivity

Chart show changes in datasets through animations. Chart components can handle mouse events.

### Hooks

The library exports React hooks that can be used in custom components. This enables custom components to access any information about a chart that it needs. For example, a custom component can access the chart dimensions, current dataset in raw format, current dataset in a processed format, scales used for axes, or theme.

### Calculation

Some `chask` components perform a limited amount of calculation on data. For example, `Histogram` in package `@chask/xy` performs data binning to summarize a data distribution. `Quantile` in package `@chask/band` computes quantiles to display box plots. `Regression` in package `@chask/xy` performs linear modeling to display a best-fit line.

### Multiple views

`chask` provides infrastructure to create charts with multiple 'views'. For example, it is possible to create side-by-side bar graphs or side-by-side scatter graphs within a single graphic.

### Milestone animation

The library provides a scheme to animate the content of a chart based on user interactions. This can be used, for example, to make chart elements appear in stages, as if in a chart 'walk-through'.
