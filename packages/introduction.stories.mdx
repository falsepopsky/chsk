# Chask

`chask` is a charting library for React.

The library provides infrastructure to build dynamic visualizations from the ground up. It contains components to create some commonly-used charts such as bar charts or line charts, and to customize these charts with bespoke elements and styles. It also supports animations for chart-based story-telling.

Importantly, `chask` does not aim to create all possible visualization types with dedicated functions/components. Rather, the library provides building blocks to create 'skeletons' for arbitrary charts. These building blocks can be combined to create complex visualizations. The chart skeletons can also be augmented with custom components.

## Features

### Reusable components

`chask` provides re-usable components that can be applied in many chart types. For example, axes and legends can be used in both bar charts and scatter charts. A common implementation for these component means that they can be used with the same API, and also styled with the same visual styles and themes.

### Base charts

The library provides infrastructure for some commonly-used charts, for example bar charts, scatter charts, or heat maps.

### Styles and themes

All components can be customized using css. Visual styles are also adjustable via global themes. It is thus possible to quickly change the look-and-feel of charts by applying a different theme, and to create multiple charts with a consistent appearance.

### Interactivity

(Interactivity is currently limited; more on this coming soon).

### Hooks

The library exports React hooks that can be used in custom components. This enables custom components to access any information about a chart that it needs. For example, a custom component can access the chart dimensions, current dataset in raw format, current dataset in a processed format, scales used for axes, or theme.

### Calculation

Some `chask` components perform a limited amount of calculation on data. For example, `Histogram` in package `@chask/xy` performs data binning to summarize a data distribution. `Quantile` in package `@chask/band` computes quantiles to display box plots. `Regression` in package `@chask/xy` performs linear modeling to display a best-fit line.

### Multiple views

`chask` provides infrastructure to create charts with multiple 'views'. For example, it is possible to create side-by-side bar graphs or side-by-side scatter graphs within a single graphic.

### Milestone animation

The library provides a scheme to animate the content of a chart based on user interactions. This can be used, for example, to make chart elements appear in stages, as if in a chart 'walk-through'.
