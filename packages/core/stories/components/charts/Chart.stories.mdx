# Chart

<Meta title="Core/Components/Charts/Chart" />
export const Template = args => <Chart {...args} />

`Chart` is the root component for all charts produced with the chsk framework.

`Chart` itself does not draw any visible elements, but it prepares an svg element and performs other book-keeping to support other components.

<ArgsTable of={Chart} />

## Identifier

`Chart` accepts a prop `id` that is intended as a unique chart identifier. This prop is used to declare css styles that are specific to a chart.

## Sizing and padding

By default, `Chart` creates a component with non-zero dimensions. The absolute width and height can be adjusted with prop `size`. Another prop `padding` creates space between the chart edges and the area used for subsequent visualization.

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="custom size"
        args={{
            size: [400, 200],
            padding: [20, 20, 20, 20],
            children: <Surface variant={'inner'} />,
        }}
        component={Chart}
        decorators={[DivDecorator]}
    >
        {Template.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

Boolean prop `stretch` overrides prop `size` and makes the chart fill its parent container. In the example below, a container has a fixed height and a variable width that fills the available screen space. The chart is configured to stretch to fill the parent container. Resize the browser window to see the container and the chart change shape.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="stretch">
        <div
            style={{
                width: '100%',
                height: '200px',
                border: 'solid 1px #aaaa33',
                display: 'inline-block',
            }}
        >
            <Chart size={[400, 300]} stretch={true} padding={[40, 40, 40, 40]}>
                <Surface variant={'inner'} />
            </Chart>
        </div>
    </Story>
</Canvas>

## Data

Prop `data` provides the chart with custom settings.

This data object is not meant to contain primary data for visualization; primary data should be provided to specific view components such as `Bar`, `Scatter`, or others depending on the desired output.

Rather, the `data` object can contain settings for downstream components. For example, this object can be used to provide state for milestone animations. However, for most simple charts, this prop is not needed and can be safely ignored.
