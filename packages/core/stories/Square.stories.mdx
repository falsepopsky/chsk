# Square

<Meta title="Core/Components/Square" />
export const Template = args => <Square {...args} />

`Square` displays a square shape.

<ArgsTable of={Square} />

Geometrically, squares are a special types of rectangles. In chask, square shapes can be produced using the `Rectangle` component. Indeed, `Rectangle` is a more versatile component with more features than `Square`. However, `Square` is relevant in that its API is equivalent to `Circle` and other symbols like `Triangle` or `Diamond`. This component can thus be used to display points, for example in legends and in scatter plots.

## Styles

Squares can be styled using css.

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="styled"
        args={{
            style: { fill: '#dd9999', stroke: '#993333', strokeWidth: '1px' },
            cx: 160,
            cy: 110,
            r: 20,
        }}
        component={Square}
        decorators={[ChartDecorator]}
    >
        {Template.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>
