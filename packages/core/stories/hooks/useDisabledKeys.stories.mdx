# `useDisabledKeys`

The `useDisabledKeys` hook retrieves information about 'keys' that have been disabled, for example via the legend.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
import { useDisabledKeys } from '@chask/core'

// in a JSX component:
const { disabledKeys, firstRender } = useChartData()
`} />

-   `disabledKeys` will be a set of string containing those 'keys' that have been marked as disabled.

-   `firstRender` will be a boolean value. The value is a guess that indicates whether or not the set of disabled keys has been manipulated before or not.
