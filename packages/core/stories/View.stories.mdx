`View` is an organizational component that manages chart state. It does not display any visual elements on a chart, but it prepares data for display. In particular, it defines scales for the axes and prepares data for plotting.

<ArgsTable of={View} />

For examples, see the documentation for components such as `Axis`, which rely on the definitions of scales in `View` to display axes and tick marks.
