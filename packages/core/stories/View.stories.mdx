`View` is an organizational component. It does not display any visual elements on a chart, but it manages internal chart state. In particular, it prepares data for display, and defines the scales for the axes.

<ArgsTable of={View} />

For examples, see the documentation for components such as `Axis`, which rely on the definitions of scales in `View` to display axes and tick marks.
