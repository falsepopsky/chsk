# Common props

Some props appear in common in the APIs of many components.
These common props perform a similar function across all components.
To avoid repetition in the documentation, these props are outlined below instead of in the the pages dedicated to individual components.

## `className`

The prop `className` accepts a string. Its value is passed to an svg component as a class.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
// source JS code

<Circle r={2} class={'special'}} />

// resulting SVG code

<circle role="default" r="2" class="special"></circle>
`} />

The class affects the appearance of the graphical components, but only if style definitions within a `<style>` tag include entries that correspond that class. Such style definitions are set through themes.

## `setRole`

The prop `setRole` toggles the `role` attribute in the svg graphic.
By default, the `setRole` prop is set to `true` so that the graphic source code includes some semantic information.
Some examples of this behavior is demonstrates in the several pseudo-code examples on this page, even if the role is only to a string 'default'.
Setting `setRole` to 'false' removes those tags.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
// source JS code

<Circle r={2} setRole={false} />

// resulting SVG code

<circle r="2"></circle>
`} />

## `style`

The prop `style` accepts objects with css definitions. These custom styles are applied inline to individual svg components.

As an example, the pseudo-code below shows the definition of `Circle` component and the resulting code in the svg graphic.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
// source JS code

<Circle r={2} style={{ stroke: 'red', strokeWidth: '2px' }} />

// resulting SVG code

<circle role="default" r="2" style="stroke: red; stroke-width: 2px;"></circle>
`} />

## `variant`

The prop `variant` is used to assign a semantic role and a visual style to a component.
The detailed behavior of the prop is component-dependent.

In some cases, for example with the `Typography` component, information in the `variant` prop is copied into the graphic in a straightforward manner.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
// source JS code

<Typography variant={'title'}>Title</Typography>

// resulting SVG code

<text role="title" class="title">
    Title
</text>
`} />

In other cases, for example with the `Axis` component, `variant` triggers more complex changes.
In the case of `Axis`, the prop determines whether the axis components appear on the top, bottom, left, or right sides of a chart.
