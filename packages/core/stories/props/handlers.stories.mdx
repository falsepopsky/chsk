# Handlers

Handlers are functions that perform bespoke actions in response to user interactions.
In chsk, there are two types of handlers - one type that applies to individual components,
and another that is used by components that create many visual elements in batch.

## Handlers for individual components

Components such as `Rectangle` and `Path` create single visual elements on a chart.
Such components accept handlers for common mouse events: mouse enter, mouse move, mouse leave, and click.

Handlers for individual components receive as input an object summarizing the triggering event.
A custom implementation is as follows.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
const handleIndividualClick = (event) => {
  console.log('handling event')
}`}
/>

Such a custom handler can be provided to a component via one of the handler props: `onMouseEnter`,
`onMouseMove`, `onMouseLeave`, and `onClick`.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
<Rectangle x={0} y={0} width={10} height={10} onClick={handleIndividualClick} />
`}
/>

## Data-dependent handlers

Some components, especially in add-on packages, create several visual components in batch based on a dataset.
For example, `Bars` (from the `@chsk/band` package) creates many rectangles to represent bars in a bar chart.
In such scenarios, handlers receive two inputs: a data object and another object summarizing the triggering event.

An implementation of a custom handler can have two arguments.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
const handleDataClick = (data, event) => {
  console.log('clicked ' + JSON.stringify(data))
}`}
/>

The content of the data object varies.
In the bar chart context, for example, it would contain identifiers and data values for bars in the chart.

Data-dependent handlers should be grouped and provided as a single prop `handlers`.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
<Bars handlers={{ onClick: handleDataClick }} />
`}
/>

This API with prop `handlers` is a design choice with following rationale:
(1) it emphasizes the difference in functional signature for data-dependent and individual handlers;
(2) it provides some consistency with definitions for style modifiers (see section on style modifiers);
(3) it allows components such as `Bars` to group props and simplify internal prop propagation.
