# Modifiers

Modifiers are style definitions that augment a base style.
They can be used to adjust visual appearance in response to events.

In the `@chsk/core` package, modifiers are used in the low-level `DataComponent` and `TooltipDataComponent` functions.
In practice, modifiers are more often used by add-on packages. They can be used, for example,
to change fill or stroke properties as the mouse hovers over data elements.

As an example, consider the following modifiers object.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
const customModifiers = {
  onMouseEnter: { stroke: '#000000' },
  onMouseClick: { strokeWidth: 2 },
  onMouseLeave: { }
}`}
/>

When creating a bars in a bar chart with `Bars`, this object can be provided to prop `modifiers`.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
<Bars modifiers={customModifiers} />
`}
/>

As a result, bars in the chart should adjust their appearance in response to the mouse events specified
in the custom modifiers object, i.e. mouse enter, mouse click, and mouse leave.

Note that style modifications are not animated by the chsk framework.
However, styles in the modifiers may contain [css animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation).
