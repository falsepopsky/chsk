# `@chask/xy`

The `@chask/xy` package builds upon the infrastructure provided by `@chask/core`.
It introduces components relevant to 'xy charts' - charts in which
both the horizontal and vertical axes display continuous values.

`@chask/xy` supports scatter charts, line charts, area charts, and histograms.
