`Scatter` sets up a view for a scatter plot.

<ArgsTable of={Scatter} />

`Scatter` is an organizational component and it does not actually draw any visual elements. However, it manages data representations that can be visualized with other components, for example `ScatterPoints` or `ScatterCurve`.
