# Using the documentation

This documentation site, powered by [storybook.js](https://storybook.js.org/), contains both static and interactive content.

## Organization

The documentation is divided into three sections.

- Section `CORE` contains information about the `@chask/core` package. This section describes general-purpose components and hooks. These elements provide infrastructure and basic building blocks for constructing composite visualization.

- `ADDONS` describes elements that are specific to certain chart types, for example to bar charts or to scatter charts. This section also describes components for adding chart annotations, and to applying style themes.

- The `GALLERY` contains examples of complete charts that combine multiple components.


## Canvas and Docs modes

The documentation pages have a toolbar at the top with two buttons: 'Canvas' and 'Docs'.

By default, the documentation pages appear in 'Docs' mode and display text descriptions. Many of the pages include examples (called storybook stories) that consist of minimal charts that showcase a single element. These examples appear static in 'Docs' mode, but in many cases they are interactive widgets.

To activate interactive story editing, select the 'Canvas' button at the top of the page. The page should switch to display a single example (called storybook story). Ensure that the 'addons' / 'controls' tab is enabled (use the storybook three-dots menu, or press 'A' on the keyboard). The controls tab should display interactive text boxes or other form elements. Use these controls to see how various props affect the visual appearance of the chart.
