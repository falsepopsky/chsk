# Using the documentation

The documentation is divided into three sections.

Section `CORE` contains information about the `@chask/core` package. This section describes general-purpose components and hooks that are the building blocks for constructing composite visualizations.

`ADDONS` describes elements that are specific to certain chart types, for example to bar charts or to scatter charts. This section also describes components for adding chart annotations, and to applying style themes.

The `GALLERY` contains examples of complete charts that combine multiple components.

### Note on interactivity

The documentation site is powered by [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), and each page has a toolbar at the top with two buttons: 'Canvas' and 'Docs'.

By default, pages appear in 'Docs' mode. Many pages in the `CORE` and `ADDONS` sections include examples (called storybook stories) that consist of minimal charts that showcase a single element. These examples appear static in 'Docs' mode, but in many cases they are interactive widgets.

To explore the examples interactively, select the 'Canvas' button in the toolbar. The page should switch to display a single example (i.e. a single storybook story). Ensure that the 'addons' / 'controls' tab is enabled (use the storybook three-dots menu, or press 'A' on the keyboard). The controls tab should display text boxes or other form elements. Use these controls to see how various props affect rendering of the example.
