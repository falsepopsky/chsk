# Using the documentation

## Organization

**CORE.** The first part describes the `@chsk/core` package, which provides general-purpose components and hooks. These elements are the building blocks for constructing composite visualizations.

**ADDONS.** While the core package provides infrastructure, add-on packages provide practical elements for specific chart types. For example, add-on packages can be used to create bar charts or scatter charts. Add-on packages also provide components for chart annotations and style themes.

**GALLERY.** The gallery contains examples of complete charts that combine multiple components.

## Note on interactivity

The documentation site is powered by [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), and each page has a toolbar at the top with two buttons: 'Canvas' and 'Docs'.

By default, pages appear in 'Docs' mode. Many include examples (called storybook stories) that consist of minimal charts that showcase a single element. These examples appear static in 'Docs' mode, but in many cases they are interactive widgets.

To explore the examples interactively, select the 'Canvas' button in the toolbar. The page should switch to display a single example (i.e. a single storybook story). Ensure that the 'addons' / 'controls' tab is enabled (use the storybook three-dots menu, or press 'A' on the keyboard). The controls tab should display text boxes or other form elements. Use these controls to see how various props affect rendering of the example.
