# Complete Themes

Complete themes are objects that satisfy typescript type `CompleteThemeSpec` from `@chsk/core`.

## `darkTheme`

`darkTheme` defines a theme suitable for use with dark backgrounds.
But apart from reversing dark and light colors, `darkTheme` is otherwise very similar to the default theme.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="dark">
        <ThemeController
            chart={ThemeScatterChart}
            chartId={'darkTheme'}
            themes={{ darkTheme, defaultTheme }}
            baseTheme={true}
        />
    </Story>
</Canvas>

Note that if a chart specifies colors using inline styles, those styles will not be affected by the theme.
In the chart above, for example, the regression line specifies a dark-gray color with a `stroke` setting passed to a `style` prop,
and that color is not adjusted via the theme, becoming almost imperceptible on a dark background.
This detail reveals that toggling themes may not automatically give perfect outcomes,
and some charts may require manual adjustment.

## `emptyTheme`

`emptyTheme` is an object that satisfies the `CompleteThemeSpec` interface but does not hold any data.

As evidenced in the example below, using `emptyTheme` on its own produces very poor outcomes.
The value of `emptyTheme` lies entirely as a bare-bones structure that can be augmented with custom definitions.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="empty">
        <ThemeController
            chart={ThemeScatterChart}
            chartId={'emptyTheme'}
            themes={{ emptyTheme, defaultTheme }}
            baseTheme={true}
        />
    </Story>
</Canvas>
