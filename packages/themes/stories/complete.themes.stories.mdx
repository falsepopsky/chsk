# Complete Themes

The `@chask/themes` package contains a collection of theme objects. Each theme
defines a distinctive look-and-feel.

To apply one of the themes to a chart, import the corresponding object and pass it to the prop `theme` in a `Chart` component, as in the pseudo-code below.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
import { classicTheme } from '@chask/themes'

<Chart {...props} theme={classicTheme}>
    ...
</Chart>
`} />

## `classicTheme`

The classic theme is characterized by prominent axes with strong lines and large tick labels.

This style is appropriate when it is desired to draw attention to what was measured and how (information on the axes) as much as to the results found (content of the chart).

## `minimalTheme`

The minimal theme is characterized by very few decorations. In particular, the lines for the axes and ticks are invisible.

This style is appropriate for visualizations aiming to make data patterns pop while preserving enough information on the axes to allow for interpretation.
