# Themes

Package `@chsk/themes` provides a collection of ready-made visual themes that can be applied to any chart.

The package is organized into two parts.

## Complete themes

Complete themes specify styles for multiple SVG elements (e.g. `rect`, `path`) and default prop values for multiple library-specific components (e.g. `Axis`, `Legend`).
These adjustments can affect the look-and-feel of default shapes and components.

## Theme pieces

Theme pieces specify smaller, targeted style adjustments. For example, a theme piece may tune styles associated with a specific class name.

Theme pieces are similar to complete themes in technical terms.
In particular, they have the same object format (and typescript type).
