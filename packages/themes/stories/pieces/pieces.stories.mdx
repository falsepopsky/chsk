# Theme pieces

Theme pieces are small objects (dictionaries) with combinations of css styles. The objects are
constructed to satisfy typescript type `ThemeSpec` from `@chsk/core`.

On their own, the individual pieces are unlikely to be suitable as themes for a chart.
However, the pieces can be combined with one another, with a complete theme, or with
custom styles using `mergeTheme`.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
import { mergeTheme } from '@chsk/core'

const customTheme = mergeTheme(themePiece, {
... custom theme definitions ...
})
`}
/>

## `downloadThemePiece`

`downloadThemePiece` holds definitions for `text`, `rect`, and `path` associated with css class `'download'`.

This theme piece may be suitable for labels and buttons.
It is used in some of the examples in the gallery to style buttons that trigger downloads of chart svg files and dataset json files.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="download">
        <ThemeController
            chart={PieceDownloadChart}
            chartId={'pieceDownload'}
            themes={{ downloadThemePiece, defaultTheme }}
        />
    </Story>
</Canvas>
