# Theme pieces

Theme pieces are small objects (dictionaries) with combinations of css styles. The objects are
constructed to satisfy typescript type `ThemeSpec` from `@chask/core`.

On their own, the individual pieces are unlikely to be suitable as themes for a chart.
However, the pieces can be combined with one another, with a complete theme, or with
custom styles using `mergeTheme`.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
import { mergeTheme } from '@chask/core'

const customTheme = mergeTheme(themePiece, {
... custom theme definitions ...
})
`}
/>

## `downloadThemePiece`

`downloadThemePiece` holds definitions for `text`, `rect`, and `path` associated with `className='download'`.

The combination of styles may be suitable for labels and buttons to download a chart to an svg file.
This theme piece is used in some of the examples in the gallery.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="downloadThemePiece 1">
        <Chart
            size={[400, 300]}
            padding={[60, 40, 40, 60]}
            style={{ display: 'inline-block' }}
            theme={downloadThemePiece}
        >
            <Surface variant={'inner'} />
            <View>
                <Rectangle
                    x={60}
                    y={60}
                    width={80}
                    height={40}
                    style={{ fill: '#dd4444' }}
                    className={'download'}
                />
                <Typography position={[60, 120]} className={'download'} children="Download" />
            </View>
        </Chart>
    </Story>
</Canvas>
